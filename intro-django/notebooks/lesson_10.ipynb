    "<h3>Defining data models (models.py)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Django web applications manage and query data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc. The definition of the model is independent of the underlying database — you can choose one of several as part of your project settings. Once you've chosen what database you want to use, you don't need to talk to it directly at all — you just write your model structure and other code, and Django handles all the \"dirty work\" of communicating with the database for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code snippet below shows a very simple Django model for a Team object. The Team class is derived from the Django class models.Model. It defines the team name and team level as character fields and specifies a maximum number of characters to be stored for each record. The team_level can be one of several values, so we define it as a choice field and provide a mapping between choices to be displayed and data to be stored, along with a default value."
