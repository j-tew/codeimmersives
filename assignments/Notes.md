## Interpeter vs. Compiler

Both are used to translate code to binary.

- Interpeter translates one line at a time
- Compiler analyzes whole program then translates

## Libraries

Libraries provides extra functionality to the core of Python.

- Use `import` funtion to use libraries
    - Use `from` to import specific modules from a library

## Functions

Functions are blocks of code that can be reused throughout the program.

- Use `def` to define a function
- Function name is followed by `()` and a `:`
- Inside the parentheses:
    - `function(PARAMETER/ARGUMENTS)`

## Data Types

- Standard
    - Numbers
        - float
        - integer
    - Strings
        - Strings are immutable
    - Booleans
        - `True`
        - `False`

- Collection
    - List
    - Tuple
    - Dictionary

## Variables

Variables are used to store data for later use.

- `=` is the Assignment Operator

## The format() method

The format() method is to format strings.

- Syntax:
    - `string.format(args)`
- Uses {x} as a placeholder
- Accepts multiple placeholders and args
    - Argument by position
        - Index of value
    - Argument by reference
        - Variable defined within the method

## f.strings()

Similar to format()
- Syntax:
        `f"string with {variable}"`
- Uses global variables

## String Methods

Methods are used to change the format of strings.
    
- .capitalize()
- .upper()
- .lower()
- .swapcase()
- .replace()
- len()
- .count()

# Add notes on lists here:

# Add notes on tuples here:

# Add notes on dictionaries here:

## Things to Remeber

- Python is a run-time
- Everything in Python is an object
- Functions use data types
- Strings are not lists
    - Bracket-notation can access index of string
    - Slicing can read a string backwards with `[::-1]`


# Exercises

**List all the functions and methods of data types, and try them all.**

**Also, try to replicate methods with your own functions.**
